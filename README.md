  ## Description
  This project test your knowledge on jest testing and node. ths project also takes aspects from the last project and deploys it on a greater scale. for instance, last week's project made us download an inquirer package and and allowed us to create a readme generator. This week we created a team profile with different roles, a manger, an engineer, and an intern. when one is prompted to select their role, they are prompted with different questions. to run the app, input in bash or VS terminal, run the command "node index.js" and the prompts will begin. However, before running initialization, we will run the test with "npm test."
